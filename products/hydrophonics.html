              Current agriculture advancement is being challenged like neverbefore with sustainable food production and
              security in a demographically obese world. Climate change is another major challenge that contemporary
              farming practice tries to overcome. Conventional soil dependent farming practices make farmers vulnerable
              to various manifestations of climate change.
            </div>
            <p>
              Hydroponic is a method where the crops are grown in the absence of soil the nutrients that are acquired
              from the soil are given to them artificially. This soil less culture of originating crops often involves
              their roots to be immersed in the nutrient solution along with some gravels or perlite medium. The maximum
              yield is achieved by the supply of sufficient quantity of nutrients and optimum microclimatic conditions
              are the main goal of hydroponics.

              Composition of nutrient solution, electrical conductivity, pH and oxygen concentration have direct
              influence on the yield and quality of crops grown under hydroponics.
            </div>
            <p>
              The IoT plays a major role in the automation process. Automating this hydroponic system is the most
              crucial part, this can be easily achieved by integrating the hydroponic system with the IoT. Cloud
              database acts as the hub for the whole automation process, this database contains all the information on
              the hydroponic system that is it has the information on the data that has been retrieved from the crops
              and the water tank
            </p>
            <p>
              Hydroponics system with manual processing and monitoring which gives less yield and efficiency. Nutrient
              mixing is the important aspect of the system which directly affects the plant growth. Monitoring,
              maintaining and controlling the critical parameters such as pH, TDS, EC, Water & ambient temp, humidity,
              nutrient mixer manually is a tedious process and may lead to human errors which will affect the overall
              yield.
            </p>
            <p>
              This system aims to provide the ideal environment for plants to grow, a system where pH, water level, air
              temperature and relative humidity are constantly monitored. Additionally, with the use of simple
              mechanisms, this system provides controlled irrigation of water, and nutrient solution intake. Through the
              data gathered by the sensors and the use of cloud based technology as the backend, information is stored,
              managed, applied and shared via internet by users. Management of resources in a hydroponics set-up would
              become easier and more efficient

                Provide Proper Aeration: A well-oxygenated nutrient solution is important for healthy root growth. It’s
                necessary for plant process and stimulates the growth of the beneficial organism that strengthens the
                root system. It’s never a bad idea to add an extra air stone to maintain a high amount of dissolved
                oxygen.
